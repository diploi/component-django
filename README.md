Getting started guide
https://diploi.com/blog/hosting_django_apps

A generic Django component ready to build your Django app.

This component was kickstarted running
`django-admin startproject djangoapp`
and it has `DEBUG=true` inside **settings.py** by default

**To secure your Django app,** you must **update your SECRET_KEY in settings.py**

By default all Django apps use SQlite, which you must update to use your database of choice inside **settings.py**

Uses the official [astral-sh/uv:3.13-alpine](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pkgs/container/uv) Docker image and Django

#### IMPORTANT
- You must generate a new SECRET_KEY for your own application
- Remember to update the database settings inside **settings.py** to match your own database config
- In production you must remember to update your **settings.py**, by changing `DEBUG=false` and if you want to use external CDNs for your static files, you will need to update the `STATIC_ROOT`
- For production and development, you are free to change the app server runner, so for example, if you prefer `uwsgi` you can change it directly on the Dockerfile for production and development
- To install new packages, this component uses `uv`, so you can add new packages using `uv add <name-of-package>`

## Operation

### Getting started

1. In the Dashboard, click **Create Project +**
2. Under **Pick Components**, choose **Django**
3. In **Pick Add-ons**, you can add one or multiple databases to your app
4. Choose **Create Repository**, which will generate a new GitHub repo
5. Now click **Launch Stack**

### Development

Will run
`uv sync`
when component is first initialized, and `uv run --isolated python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000` when deployment is started.

### Production

Will build a production ready image. The first step runs the command:
`uv sync --locked --no-dev --group deploy`
Which installs **gunicorn**, as part of `--group=deploy` in `pyproject.toml`, to install all necessary dependencies for production.

To get all static files, the image runs the command:
`uv run --locked --no-dev python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` to get all static files.

Lastly, the image will start the production server with the command:
`uv run gunicorn djangoapp.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 3 --log-level info`
